    <p>
        One of the min things we were asked to build from day one as a table showing all the dates of the semester. 
        In our first sprint we built two hard coded tables to show all the dates two semesters. 
        Even when we did this, we knew it would have to be changed eventually but we were not sure in what way yet. 
        During the second sprint I was assignment a ticket to make this tables display which week was the current week. 
        After discussing it with my team we decided the best way to do this would be in Javascript.
        <br><br>
        I had written small pieces of Javascript in the past but only small functions to do with making text appear on a button click and things of this nature.
        Even though I lacked knowledge in regards to JavaScript I chose the ticket for myself because I wanted to take it as an opportunity to work with more complex Javascript than I had in the past and learn some in the process. 
        I started to write a Javascript file that would do this by detecting the dates that were hardcoded into the html but didnâ€™t get very far.
