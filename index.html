    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>
        Over the course of the semester our ability to communicate as a group improved a lot. 
        I believe this is one of the reasons we managed to deliver a relatively complete product. 
        I believe this because when we first started working on the project as a group, we would only really communicate when we met in class time for this paper and during other classes when we happened to share them. 
        This worked okay when we were in more of a planning faze for the project, but we realised once we had started to work on actually building the project and were attempting to do daily scrums that this was not going to be enough. 
        <br><br>
        We decided to make a slack channel for our group so that we could communicate with each other while not face to face. 
        Although, we also decided as a group that this channel should really only be used for asking for the occasional bit of help but mainly for organizing face to face meetings as they are the most efficient way of communicating and getting things done. 
        Once we had this our daily scrums became more regular and we were able to organize meetings to work on and discuss the work we had to do outside of class time.</p>

        Although we had this channel and were organizing meetings outside of class. 
        We were not all fully communicating. People would occasionally miss a meeting or be rather late without notice. 
        This was discussed as something to work on during a sprint retrospective and we all made an effort to improve on our communication even more than we had by doing better at this.

        Principle six of Agile states: "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation". 
        Our use of face-to-face meetings shows that we followed this principle very well. 
        This helped us to work better as a group because it definitely improved our one-on-one communication between team members, as opposed to if we had tried to talk things out via the slack channel or similar means.

    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to time management, I have never been particularly good at it. 
        I usually get the work I have to do done but am particularly bad at leaving it until the very last minute. 
        This semester has been a big semester over all for me with all my papers and having lots of work to do from week to week, having checkpoint work to complete for Programming and database papers while also working to support myself financially. 
        Being this busy has forced me to work better at setting myself a schedule of when to complete all of my assigned classwork. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of our sprints were two weeks in length, starting and ending on Thursdays. 
        The plan I set for myself for working on my assigned tickets for each sprint was to other than working in class time, use my weekends. 
        Usually working on Saturday mornings meant I was usually quite tired for the rest of the day and not always able to use my brain particularly well. 
        This led me to decide that I would get most of my work done on my tickets on Sundays, having the entire day to work on things. I also had no classes on Mondays so even though I had work on Monday nights, this gave me plenty of time to get back to things on Monday if there was more for me to do or if I for some reason could not get much done on Sunday. 
        I chose this time of week because it meant I could come back to class on Tuesday to show my team what I had achieved, still having what I had done fresh in my mind. 
        This helped to talk people through code I had written, show specific parts I thought might be important and ask for assistance on things I was struggling with while still remembering the exact issue.
